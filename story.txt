There once was a bug named Bob who lived in the forest.  Every day Bob would climb up his favorite tree. One day he found he lives in a big city named RBT, which contains lots of bugs.
To fix those bugs, Bob decided to go out for an adventure. 
Bob got bored and decided to take a nap. When he woke up, he had many bug bites. He wished he would've fixed his bugs before resting! The End.
